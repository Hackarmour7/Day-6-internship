📄 README: Password Security Evaluation
🔍 Objective:
Understand how password complexity impacts security through testing and analysis.

✅ Steps:
Created passwords with varying complexity.

Included uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.

Tested passwords using strength checkers (zxcvbn, Kaspersky).

Noted feedback and crack time estimates.

Identified strong password traits.

Researched common attacks (brute-force, dictionary, credential stuffing).

Summarized how complexity improves resistance to attacks.

📌 Key Learnings:
Longer = Stronger: Length boosts resistance more than just adding symbols.

Avoid patterns: No names, dates, or common phrases.

Use passphrases: Example – Sunlight@Over$Mountain2025

Never reuse passwords.

Use MFA + Password Managers for max security.

🎯 Outcome:
Improved understanding of password creation, attack resistance, and best security practice
